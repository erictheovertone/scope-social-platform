# Scope — Claude Code Context

## What is Scope
Scope is a cinematic social platform for visual creators. The core differentiator is a
per-user grid layout system — each user chooses how their posts display on their profile,
with support for ultra-wide (2.4:1) and cinematic (16:9) aspect ratios that Instagram
doesn't support. Posts are minted as ERC-1155 tokens on Base, making content collectible.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Auth**: Privy — email, Google, Farcaster, X login; auto-creates embedded wallet on Base
- **Database**: Supabase (Postgres with RLS)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (bucket: `post-media`, public)
- **Blockchain**: Base mainnet, ERC-1155 tokens (not yet implemented)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (target), Netlify (current config)

## Design System
- **Font**: IBM Plex Mono for all text — import via Google Fonts or local
- **Colors**: Black `#000000` backgrounds, white `#FFFFFF` text, red `#FF0000` accent only
- **Red dot**: The Scope logo is a 15x15px red circle, top-left at 10px from edges
- **Layout**: Mobile-first, target 375px wide — currently fixed, needs to become responsive
- **Spacing**: Minimal. Let content breathe. No decorative borders or dividers.
- **Buttons**: Transparent background, white text, thin borders where needed
- **No rounded corners** on most UI elements — square/sharp is intentional

## Database Schema (Supabase)
```sql
users         — id, privy_id, wallet_address, created_at
profiles      — id, user_id, display_name, username, bio, profile_image_url, grid_layout, created_at
posts         — id, user_id, username, caption, media_urls (text[]), layout_id, created_at
likes         — id, post_id, user_id, username, created_at
comments      — id, post_id, user_id, username, content, created_at
```
RLS is enabled on all tables. Users can only write their own data. All content is publicly readable.

## Grid Layout System
This is Scope's core feature. Each user picks a layout that controls how their posts
display on their profile. Layout IDs and their display rules:

| Layout ID  | Columns | Aspect Ratio       |
|------------|---------|--------------------|
| 2x-16:9    | 2       | aspect-video       |
| 2x-2.4:1   | 2       | aspect-[2.4/1]     |
| 1x-16:9    | 1       | aspect-video       |
| 1x-2.4:1   | 1       | aspect-[2.4/1]     |
| 3x-4:3     | 3       | aspect-[4/3]       |
| collage    | 2       | alternating by index: video / [2.4/1] / [4/3] / square |

Layout is saved in `profiles.grid_layout` and retrieved via `gridLayoutService.ts`.

## Known Issues (fix in this order)
1. **Auto-crop on upload** — images are not cropped to the selected layout's aspect ratio
   on upload. A photo larger or smaller than the target ratio should be center-cropped
   to fit correctly before being stored.
2. **Public profile page empty** — `profile/[username]/page.tsx` exists but is not built.
3. **Responsive sizing** — some pages still use fixed `w-[375px]` / `h-[812px]`. Needs
   to be fully responsive.
4. **Screening Room / discovery feed** — not yet built.

### Fixed
- ~~**Grid layout not applied**~~ — fixed. `profile/page.tsx` now reads `grid_layout`
  from Supabase and applies correct columns and aspect ratios via `getGridCols` /
  `getPostAspect`.
- ~~**Media stored as base64**~~ — fixed. `CreatePostFlow.tsx` uploads to Supabase
  Storage bucket `post-media` and stores public URLs.
- ~~**Profile setup doesn't reliably save to Supabase**~~ — fixed. Silent localStorage
  fallback removed; shows inline error and blocks navigation on failure.
- ~~**Username hardcoded**~~ — fixed. `CreatePostFlow.tsx` fetches real username from
  the user's Supabase profile before posting.

## Not Yet Built (do not attempt without being asked)
- Onchain minting (ERC-1155 on Base)
- Liquidity pool mechanics
- 3% transaction fee smart contract
- Collect / buy post tokens
- Trending feed filters
- Follows / followers
- Wallet balance with real token data

## Rules for This Codebase
- **Always read files before editing them**
- **Make surgical changes** — don't refactor working code while fixing something else
- **Never use alert()** — show inline error messages in the UI
- **Never hardcode user data** — always fetch from Supabase or Privy
- **Test the auth flow** — most features require an authenticated Privy user
- **Supabase client** — always import from `@/lib/supabase/client`, not `@/lib/supabase`
- **No new dependencies** without asking first
- When adding SQL changes, output the migration SQL separately so it can be run manually
